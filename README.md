Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

Fix a broken version of a responsive website in this project!

In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will be provided specs to help guide you in making adjustments to the broken code. Download the broken code [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/capstone_fotomatic_start.zip?_gl=1*8539s1*_ga*MDU4NzMzMDI1Ny4xNjU3NDc5NTEw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTI2NjI1OS43Mi4xLjE2NzUyNzA5ODUuNjAuMC4w) and the specs [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png?_gl=1*ufns5w*_ga*MDU4NzMzMDI1Ny4xNjU3NDc5NTEw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTI2NjI1OS43Mi4xLjE2NzUyNzA5ODUuNjAuMC4w). You can also see a working version of the final product [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/solution/index.html?_gl=1*ufns5w*_ga*MDU4NzMzMDI1Ny4xNjU3NDc5NTEw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTI2NjI1OS43Mi4xLjE2NzUyNzA5ODUuNjAuMC4w).

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.

## Developer Notes:

* Specifications picture was misleading as some of the specs detailed was not correct and it didn't match with the template page.

* This is a responsive website that I edited using flexbox and Media Queries, which I learned in chapter 9 (Making a Website Responsive).

* This is an Off-Platform Project which was edited using Visual Studio Code and Chrome DevTools.
